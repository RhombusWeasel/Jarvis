# Jarvis
Seen Iron Man?  It's exactly what you think.

Download the selenium_driver.exe of your choice, it doesn't have to be chromedriver.exe but it has to be called chromedriver.exe and placed in the Jarvis (root) directory.

Create a venv and activate it then run
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You'll need to add your openAI API key to the secrets.json file 
There is a customizable preferences file to configure your code preferences and tell Jarvis your name and where you live and things you like or dislike.
All preferences get sent with every command so be aware lots of preferances equals higher API cost.
