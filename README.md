# Jarvis
Seen Iron Man?  It's exactly what you think.

Download the selenium_driver.exe of your choice, it doesn't have to be chromedriver.exe but it has to be called chromedriver.exe and placed in the Jarvis (root) directory.

Create a venv and activate it then run
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You'll need to add your openAI API key to the secrets.json file and there is a customizable preferences file to configure your code 
preferences and tell Jarvis your name and where you live
